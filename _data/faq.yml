- question : What do I need to do to apply to the ODU-REU program in Computer Science?
  answer : >-
    Applicants will be evaluated on academics, research/work experience, and interest in Transportation as a field of study or possible career. Applications are due February 15, 2022.
    There are several steps to applying:

    1. Read through the available projects (located in the "projects" tab) and identify which projects you would be most interested in working on.

    2. Complete the Application form (located in the "apply" tab). Remember to complete all fields and to press "submit" when you are done!

    3. Gather your supporting documents. You will need to email reu.transportation.odu@gmail.com the following documents in order to be considered for the program:
      * A resume or CV
      * A cover letter (up to one page) detailing your interest in transportation sciences, relevant research experience and career or academic goals
      * An unofficial transcript of all colleges you've attended (official transcripts will be required on acceptance to the program)
      * One letter of recommendation
      * A writing sample (must have been written independently, not part of a group project).

- question : What if I haven't declared a major yet? Can I still apply?
  answer : >-
    Yes! Preference will be given to applicants with a background in psychology, engineering or other STEM fields, but we encourage all majors with a
    strong interest in Transportation sciences to apply (including those who have not yet declared a major).

- question : My college doesn't have many research opportunities. Can I apply even if I don't have research experience?
  answer : >-
    Yes! Students with a strong interest in transportation science from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply. In addition,
    we strongly encourage applicants from groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields (women, minorities, and persons with disabilities).

- question : What will I be doing over the summer if I am accepted?
  answer : >-
    The REU program is 10 weeks long. It is a full-time program. You will be working alongside a faculty mentor to complete a project.
    Once a week, there will be an event focused on your professional or academic development.
    This might include guest lecturers from the transportation field, workshops on how to apply to graduate programs,
    or field trips to transportation research centers.
